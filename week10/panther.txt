================================

Riboflavin is a B vitamin that must be transported into the body.  It is used as a coenzyme for several flavoprotein enzyme reactions.  It makes sense that this would be important for mouse development, so the riboflavin transporter would plan an important role.

Additionally, this proteinâ€™s role as a G-protein-coupled receptor suggests its importance in signaling and signal amplification, something that is important during development. Many of the genes in its kmeans group are also identified by PANTHER as related to signaling pathways. Further, many of these genes are classified as having catalytic molecular function, as well as roles in cellular processes, developmental processes, and metabolic processes.  These processes are especially important during development.
