Question 1: Briefly comment on the trends you see in the gut microbiota throughout the first week.
Throughout the time period, Enterococcus faecalis makes up the largest percentage.  Over time, Staphococcus aureus, Staphococcus epidermis, and Cutibacterium avidum make up larger and larger percentages of the reads.

Question 2: What metrics in the contigs can we use to group them together?
Want to be sure that they overlap and come from the same or similar organisms.  Probably use exact overlaps first, then look at sequence homology to align similar species.

Question 3: How many bins did you get? Roughly what percentage of the assembly do they represent? Do you think the sizes of each bin look about right based on what you know about the size of prokaryotic genomes? How would you estimate how complete and how contaminated each bins is?
8 bins, with nodes of sizes ranging from tens to hundreds of kilobases, which are significantly smaller than prokaryotic genome sizes, but should be large enough to give good accuracy.
contamination: determine whether the nodes that have been grouped together all have the same KRAKEN organism assignment
completeness: if whole genome size is known for the organism, determine size of binned contigs and compare to full genome

Question 4: This approach to classification is fast, but also not very quantitative. Propose one method to more robustly estimate the taxonomy of a metagenomic bin.
Use the most common organism assignment among all nodes in a given bin.

Question 5: Compare the results of the individual genome abundance analysis to the conclusions you derived from looking at the read taxonomy distributions. Do they agree with each other? What is different?
The heatmap reveals the rare species.  The read taxonomy distributions really only show the two most populous bins.
